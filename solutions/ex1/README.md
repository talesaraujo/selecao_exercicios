# renomear.py

*renomear* is a simple script that allows you to rename all files from a folder following a number sequence.

## Usage

Simply run
```bash
renomear.py --input "path/to/the/folder"
```

## Run tests

A compressed file named `img_samples.zip` contains some randomly named image samples, in which you can use to perform tests. To do so, run

```bash
python -m unittest test_renomear
```
